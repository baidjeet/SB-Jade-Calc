# SB Jade Calc
This project provides a Selenium-based scraper for calculating the potential revenue from selling or crafting gemstones in the game Skyblock. It handles different types of gem calculations including rough, flawed, fine, and flawless gems.


## Prerequisites

Before running the script, you need to install the required Python packages:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```
### Running

1. Go to wherever you have the code downloaded and into a folder ex: "C:\Users\___\Desktop\gemcalc\SB-Jade-Calc"
2. Click the location highlighted in the image below

3. In the selected box, select all and write 'cmd'
4. Once the terminal opens up, paste 'py gemsel.py'
5. The bot should now start running

#### Notes

Currently with the use of selenium it loads the required data on the skyblock.bz website.

AS FAR AS I KNOW ITS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET RATE LIMITED ON THEIR WEBSITE UNLESS you're a dumbass; I did not get rate limited once whilst developing this.
